<h1>Calculator using React : Advance</h1>
<p>I have created a calculator using React library which offers different features like light mode and dark mode, and also stores history in local memory.You can also input numbers using the keyboard. Moreover, this calculator is fully responsive, which means it can adjust its size according to the screen size of the device being used.</p>
